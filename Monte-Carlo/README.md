Here is an example of the NaI Gamma Ray Detector Monte Carlo Model made in [GEANT4](https://geant4.cern.ch/)

- [Detector Build](https://github.com/khadamich/Portfolio/tree/main/Monte-Carlo/Detector-Build): Its basically where you construct all detector geometry, physics etc for the simulation.
- [Fuentes](https://github.com/khadamich/Portfolio/tree/main/Monte-Carlo/FUENTES): The detector model.

Read [GEANT4](https://geant4.cern.ch/) for more details.

This is an overview of how the detector model looks like:
