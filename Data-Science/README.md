- [Winnning Space Race with Data Science](https://github.com/khadamich/Portfolio/tree/main/Data-Science/Winning-Space-Race-with-Data-Science-main): The final project of my IBM Data Science Professional Certificate in which I had to applied Machine Learning models to predict if the first stage of the Falcon9 rockets of SpaceX will land succesfully.
- [Real Madrid Campeon](https://github.com/khadamich/Portfolio/tree/main/Data-Science/Real-Madrid-Campeon): Is the project in which Im currently working. Im a huge Real Madrid and I want to apply my knowlegde to predict if Real Madrid is gonna win the 2023-2024 Season of La Liga.
- [Magnesium](https://github.com/khadamich/Portfolio/tree/main/Data-Science/Magnesium): A freelance project I got in Upwork where a student want me to apply Artifical Neural Networks to predict the corrosion energy and the corrosion current for different compunds having Magnesium.
